# Operation Override

## Background

This was originally a game made for an in-person school event which ran on May 26, 2025. Each "station" in the game was held in a different room, so people had to go physically around the school to solve different problems. To ensure that people had to move around instead of staying in one spot, each station required an "entry code" in game which was provided physically in the rooms. One of the stations (Recon) even provided critical information (the ciphered messages) physically in the room, to more closely integrate the digital and physical parts of the event. 

Here are some pictures of that event:

## Current State

Now Operation Override has been modified to work as a standalone game, without any physical component required. The original version still exists on the "event" branch. Note that this was made extremely quickly, and it was my (Empika1's) first ever time making a website or doing any sort of web dev, so there's likely a lot of jank, especially in the CSS. Nevertheless, it works.
